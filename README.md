## How it works?

It replaces styles and symbols by name. It doesn't matter if the symbols are nested or not, if the styles are local or pointing an external library or if they are applied to shapes or symbol overrides, Camilo will replace all of them by name 🙌🏼 🎈 🎉

* if the style doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten

It replaces symbols by name

* if the symbol doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten

## Usage

* Download the `example` zip file [here](https://github.com/Pausansol/Camilo/releases/download/v1.4/Camilo_example.zip).

* Install the main library and the brand libraries

* Open `uiKit` file

* Press `Control + Command + C` or use the `Plugins` menu and choose brand_2 (uiKit comes with brand_1 styles applied) 

* 🎉 🎈 🙌🏼 🎈 🎉

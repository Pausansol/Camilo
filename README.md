## Overview
One click theme change for [Sketch app](https://www.sketchapp.com/). It replaces layer styles, text styles and symbols from a Sketch library with the current document. Read the history of this plugin [here](https://medium.com/makingtuenti/camilo-our-tool-and-technique-for-one-click-brand-change-in-sketch-52-2060ae4161ae). 

## 🙌 New in 1.3 🙌

- Improvements for Sketch v53
- Switch to Sketch API (thanks to mathieudutour)
- Fixed bug not replacing layer and text styles from libraries in shapes or layers
- Added symbol instances swaping improvements. 

Download the `example` zip file [here](https://github.com/Pausansol/Camilo/releases/download/v1.2/Camilo_overrides_example.zip).

## Install

* Download and install the `camilo.sketchplugin` zip file [here](https://github.com/Pausansol/Camilo/releases/download/v1.3/Camilo.sketchplugin.zip).
* If you don't have Sketch v53 yet, download the version compatible with Sketch v52 [here](https://github.com/Pausansol/Camilo/releases/download/v1.2/Camilo.sketchplugin.zip). 

## How it works?

It replaces styles overrides and local shared styles (texts and layers) by name

* if the style doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten


It replaces symbols (symbols and/or nested symbols) by name

* if the symbol doesn't exist, nothing happens
* if it does exist, it's overwritten
